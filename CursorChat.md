## Session Summary - Python & Solana Script Setup

**Date**: Current session
**Objective**: Help user install Python and get Solana transaction script running

### Events:

1. **Python Installation Check**
   - Discovered Python 3.12.7 was already installed
   - Verified `requests` library was available

2. **Script Debugging**
   - Original script used `ankr_getTransactionsByAddress` method
   - API returned "invalid argument 0: invalid params" error
   - Issue: Using Ankr's Advanced API method with incorrect parameters

3. **API Research**
   - Researched Ankr API documentation
   - Found that `ankr_getTransactionsByAddress` requires specific parameter format
   - Discovered API key didn't have Solana access permissions

4. **Solution Implementation**
   - Switched from Ankr's multichain endpoint to public Solana mainnet endpoint
   - Changed from `ankr_getTransactionsByAddress` to standard `getSignaturesForAddress` method
   - Updated parameter format to match Solana RPC specification

5. **Final Result**
   - ✅ Script successfully running
   - ✅ Fetching Solana transaction signatures
   - ✅ Displaying formatted transaction data including signatures, slots, timestamps, and confirmation status
   - ✅ Found 5 transactions for test address with detailed information

### Technical Details:
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`
- **Method**: `getSignaturesForAddress`
- **Language**: Python 3.12.7
- **Dependencies**: requests, json (built-in)

### Files Modified:
- `Sol.py` - Updated to use correct Solana RPC methods and endpoint

## Session Update - Solana Staking Rewards HTML App Fix

**Issue**: User reported 403 error when trying to use the Solana staking rewards web application

**Root Cause**: 
- Ankr RPC endpoint returning 403 Forbidden error
- Application trying to fetch ALL epochs from beginning of Solana (inefficient)
- No fallback RPC endpoints

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **RPC Endpoint Updates**:
   - Replaced single Ankr endpoint with multiple fallback endpoints
   - Added automatic failover between RPC providers
   - Primary: `api.mainnet-beta.solana.com` (official Solana)
   - Fallbacks: ProjectSerum, Ankr

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Limited epoch scanning to last ~2 years (730 epochs) instead of all history
   - Reduced batch sizes (50→25 epochs, 100→50 block times)
   - Added delays between requests to avoid rate limiting
   - Improved error handling with graceful degradation

3. **Reliability Improvements**:
   - Added retry logic with different RPC endpoints
   - Better error messages and status logging
   - Graceful handling of partial failures

**Expected Result**: Application should now work reliably for fetching Solana staking rewards and generating Koinly-compatible CSV files.

### Final Update - Rate Limiting & User Experience Improvements

**Issue**: Demo RPC endpoints were getting overwhelmed by parallel requests for historical data

**Additional Fixes**:
1. **Sequential Processing**: Changed from parallel batch processing to sequential epoch-by-epoch processing
2. **Respectful Rate Limiting**: Added 500ms delays between requests to avoid overwhelming free endpoints
3. **User Choice**: Added time range selector (2 months to 2 years) so users can choose speed vs completeness
4. **Better Progress Tracking**: Shows current progress (epoch X of Y) during processing
5. **Graceful Error Handling**: Skips failed epochs instead of stopping completely

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ Successfully connects via Alchemy demo endpoint
- ✅ Finds stake accounts correctly
- ✅ Processes rewards data sequentially with proper rate limiting
- ✅ Provides user control over time range vs speed tradeoff

### Files Modified:
- `SolanaStaking.html` - Complete overhaul of RPC handling, performance optimizations, and UX improvements 

## Latest Update: Public Sharing Preparation

**Date**: Current session  
**Action**: Made the application suitable for public sharing by removing hardcoded personal data and adding configurable API keys.

**Changes Made**:
1. **Added API Key Input Field**: Users can now enter their own Alchemy API key for better reliability
2. **Local Configuration Storage**: API keys and wallet addresses are saved in localStorage and auto-populated
3. **Removed Hardcoded Keys**: Eliminated personal API keys and wallet addresses from the code
4. **Created .gitignore**: Added gitignore file to exclude personal configuration files
5. **Dynamic RPC URLs**: RPC endpoints are now built dynamically based on provided API keys
6. **Cleaned Documentation**: Removed personal references from documentation files

**Files Added**:
- `config.json` - Template for personal configuration (gitignored)
- `.gitignore` - Excludes personal data from repository

**Privacy & Security**:
- ✅ No personal API keys or wallet addresses in repository
- ✅ Configuration stored locally in browser (not in files)
- ✅ API key input uses password field type
- ✅ Safe for public GitHub sharing

---

## Final Security Update: Proper External Config Loading

**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: The previous approach had hardcoded personal values as "defaults" which could be used by others accessing the HTML file.

**Security Fix**:
1. **Removed Hardcoded Values**: No personal data embedded in HTML code anymore
2. **External Config Loading**: App loads from `config.json` file (if it exists locally)
3. **Graceful Fallback**: If no config.json exists, starts with empty fields
4. **Config Download**: Users can download their own config.json file for future use

**How It Works Now**:
- **For You**: Place config.json in same directory as HTML → Auto-loads your settings
- **For Others**: No config.json → Starts with empty fields, they enter their own data
- **Config Saving**: "💾 Save Config" button downloads config.json with user's settings

**Final Security State**:
- ✅ Zero personal data in HTML file
- ✅ Zero risk of others using your API keys
- ✅ Completely safe for public sharing
- ✅ Convenient auto-loading for personal use

---

## Previous Update: Project Cleanup - Removed Unused Python Script

**Date**: Previous session  
**Action**: Removed `Sol.py` as it was not needed for the HTML staking rewards application.

**Analysis**:
- `Sol.py` was a simple Python script for fetching transaction signatures using `getSignaturesForAddress`
- `SolanaStaking.html` is a complete web application with its own JavaScript-based RPC client
- No dependencies between the two files - HTML app is fully self-contained
- Different purposes: Sol.py was for basic transaction testing, HTML is for staking rewards

**Current Project State**:
- ✅ SolanaStaking.html - Complete staking rewards web application (standalone)
- ✅ No Python dependencies required
- ✅ All functionality contained within the HTML file
- ✅ Python virtual environment (.venv) removed - no longer needed

---

## Previous Update: Smart Retry System for Missing Epochs

**Date**: Previous session  
**Issue**: User completed full history scan but was missing rewards for epochs 663 and 708. The application was marking failed epochs as "processed" and never retrying them.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Database Schema**: Added `errorType` and `retryCount` fields to track failure reasons and attempt counts
2. **Smart Retry Logic**: 
   - Distinguishes between different error types (rate_limit, network, block_unavailable, rpc_error)
   - Only marks epochs as truly "processed" when successful
   - Failed epochs remain eligible for retry based on error type and retry count
3. **Missing Epoch Detection**: New `findMissingEpochs()` function identifies gaps in data
4. **Retry Failed Button**: Yellow button appears when failed epochs exist, allows targeted retry
5. **Manual Epoch Check**: Purple "Check Specific" button reveals input field for checking specific epochs (e.g., "663, 708")
6. **Improved Status Display**: Shows successful vs failed epoch counts in database status

**Key Features**:
- Failed epochs with rate limits or network errors can be retried indefinitely
- RPC errors limited to 3 retries to avoid infinite loops
- Manual epoch input for targeted checking of specific missing epochs
- Smart processing that combines new epochs with retry candidates
- Better error categorization and logging

**Technical Changes**:
- Modified `markEpochAsProcessed()` to include error metadata
- Updated `getProcessedEpochs()` to filter by success status
- Added `getFailedEpochs()` and `findMissingEpochs()` functions
- Enhanced UI with retry and manual check buttons
- Improved error handling with specific error type detection

This ensures no epochs are permanently lost due to temporary RPC issues and provides tools for users to manually verify and retry specific epochs.

## Latest Fix: Variable Scope Error in Rewards Processing

**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: Application stopped collecting results after recent changes. Error: "selectedRange is not defined"

**Root Cause**: 
- The `selectedRange` variable was declared inside an `else` block but used outside its scope
- The `timeRangeText` calculation tried to access `selectedRange` which was only defined conditionally

**Fix Applied**:
- Moved `const selectedRange = timeRangeSelect.value;` declaration outside the conditional blocks
- Made it available to all subsequent code that needs to reference it
- Ensured proper variable scoping for the time range text generation

**Result**: 
- ✅ Application now correctly determines time range settings
- ✅ Rewards processing continues normally
- ✅ Time range text displays properly in logs

**File Modified**: `SolanaStaking.html` - Fixed variable scoping in `getRewardsForAllAccounts()` function

---

## Simplification Update: Alchemy-Only RPC Configuration

**Date**: Current session  
**Action**: Simplified the application to use only Alchemy RPC endpoints, removing all other providers.

**Changes Made**:
1. **RPC Configuration Simplified**:
   - Removed all non-Alchemy endpoints (Solana mainnet, Helius, Ankr, PublicNode, ProjectSerum)
   - Now only uses Alchemy API key endpoint + Alchemy demo endpoint as fallback
   - Updated devnet configuration to also use Alchemy-only

2. **Simplified Retry Logic**:
   - Removed complex multi-provider failover system
   - Streamlined to handle only Alchemy rate limits with progressive backoff
   - Added smart switching between API key and demo endpoints
   - Maximum 5 retries with increasing wait times (5s, 7s, 9s, 11s, 13s)

3. **Updated User Interface**:
   - Changed description text to reflect Alchemy-only approach
   - Updated tips to mention Alchemy's reliability
   - Clearer messaging about API key vs demo endpoint usage

4. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Focused error handling specifically for Alchemy responses
   - Better logging to distinguish between API key and demo endpoint usage
   - Simplified error messages without multi-provider complexity

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Reduced complexity and potential points of failure
- ✅ More predictable behavior with single provider
- ✅ Better rate limit handling specific to Alchemy
- ✅ Clearer user experience and messaging
- ✅ Still maintains fallback (demo endpoint) for users without API keys

**File Modified**: `SolanaStaking.html` - Complete RPC configuration overhaul to Alchemy-only

---

## Fix: Improved Fallback Strategy for Rate Limiting Issues

**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: User's API key was hitting immediate rate limits, and demo endpoint was also failing with network errors.

**Root Cause**: 
- API key exhausted compute units per second immediately
- Demo endpoint experiencing network connectivity issues
- No fallback options when both Alchemy endpoints fail

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Faster Fallback Strategy**:
   - Reduced retry attempts from 5 to immediate fallback for faster switching
   - API key rate limit → immediately try demo endpoint
   - Any endpoint failure → immediately try next endpoint in sequence

2. **Added Public RPC Fallbacks**:
   - Primary: Alchemy API key (if provided)
   - Secondary: Alchemy demo endpoint
   - Tertiary: Official Solana RPC (`api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`)
   - Quaternary: Ankr public RPC (`rpc.ankr.com/solana`)

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Better endpoint identification in logs (shows which type is being used)
   - Progressive fallback through all available endpoints
   - More specific error messages based on failure type

4. **Smart Retry Logic**:
   - No retries on the same endpoint for rate limits (immediate fallback)
   - 1-second delays between endpoint switches
   - Reset retry count when switching endpoints

**Expected Result**: 
- ✅ Faster recovery from rate limits
- ✅ Multiple fallback options if Alchemy fails
- ✅ Better visibility into which endpoint is being used
- ✅ Increased reliability through endpoint diversity

**File Modified**: `SolanaStaking.html` - Enhanced RPC fallback strategy and error handling

---

## Final Fix: Alchemy-Only Configuration with Proper Endpoint Reset

**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: After the previous changes, the app was getting stuck on failed non-Alchemy endpoints (Ankr 403 errors) and not resetting back to Alchemy for each new epoch request.

**Root Cause**: 
- Global `currentRpcIndex` was persisting across requests, staying on failed endpoints
- Non-Alchemy endpoints (Solana Official, Ankr) were causing issues and not needed
- Ankr endpoint was returning 403 errors blocking all subsequent requests

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Alchemy-Only Configuration**:
   - Removed all non-Alchemy endpoints completely
   - Only keeping Alchemy API key + Alchemy demo endpoints
   - Simplified configuration back to reliable Alchemy-only approach

2. **Fixed Endpoint Reset Issue**:
   - Removed global `currentRpcIndex` variable that was causing persistence
   - Each `makeRpcRequest()` now starts fresh with preferred endpoint
   - No more getting "stuck" on failed endpoints from previous requests

3. **Simplified RPC Logic**:
   - Clean for-loop through available Alchemy endpoints
   - Immediate fallback from API key to demo on rate limits
   - Better error handling specific to Alchemy responses
   - Proper "Block not available" handling for recent epochs

4. **User Experience**:
   - Updated tips to reflect Alchemy-only approach
   - Clearer messaging about API key vs demo endpoint usage
   - No more confusing references to multiple providers

**Expected Result**: 
- ✅ Always starts with Alchemy API key for each request
- ✅ Falls back to Alchemy demo when API key is rate limited
- ✅ No more getting stuck on failed non-Alchemy endpoints
- ✅ Predictable, reliable behavior with only Alchemy infrastructure
- ✅ Proper handling of epoch-specific errors (block not available)

**File Modified**: `SolanaStaking.html` - Complete reversion to Alchemy-only with fixed endpoint reset logic

## Critical Fix: Broken Timestamp Retrieval Preventing Reward Saves

**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: API calls were succeeding but no rewards were being saved to database. Database showed "10 epochs processed successfully" but "0 rewards saved".

**Root Cause**: 
- `getBlockTime()` function was still using the old `currentRpcUrls[currentRpcIndex]` approach
- This variable no longer existed after our RPC refactoring
- Timestamp retrieval was failing silently, causing `if (timestamp)` check to fail
- Rewards were being found but not saved because they had no timestamp

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Fixed getBlockTime() Function**:
   - Updated to use the new `makeRpcRequest()` method instead of direct fetch
   - Now properly uses the Alchemy endpoint fallback logic
   - Simplified code and consistent with other RPC calls

2. **Fixed getBlockTimes() Function**:
   - Updated to use the new RPC request pattern
   - Simplified from batch requests to individual requests for reliability
   - Added proper error handling and delays

3. **Added Debug Logging**:
   - Shows what the `getInflationReward` API returns for each epoch
   - Logs reward processing details (amount, slot, account)
   - Better error messages for timestamp retrieval failures
   - Distinguishes between "no rewards" vs "timestamp fetch failed"

4. **Enhanced Error Visibility**:
   - Shows when rewards are found but timestamps fail
   - Clearer logging to identify exactly where the process breaks
   - Debug info to help troubleshoot future issues

**Expected Result**: 
- ✅ Timestamp retrieval now works correctly
- ✅ Rewards with valid amounts and slots will be saved to database
- ✅ Better visibility into what's happening during processing
- ✅ Consistent use of Alchemy endpoints for all RPC calls

**File Modified**: `SolanaStaking.html` - Fixed timestamp retrieval and added debug logging

---

## Optimization: Smart API Key Exhaustion Detection

**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: User's API key was hitting rate limits immediately, causing unnecessary error messages and delays before falling back to demo endpoint.

**Improvement Made**:
1. **Smart Endpoint Selection**:
   - Added `apiKeyExhausted` flag to track when API key consistently fails with 429 errors
   - After first 429 error, subsequent requests start directly with demo endpoint
   - Eliminates repetitive error messages and delays

2. **Automatic Recovery**:
   - If API key successfully works again, resets the exhausted flag
   - Each new session resets the flag to give API key a fresh chance
   - Smart fallback behavior without losing API key functionality

3. **Cleaner Logging**:
   - Reduced verbose debug messages since system is working correctly
   - Kept essential error handling and success messages
   - More streamlined user experience

4. **User Experience**:
   - Faster processing when API key is rate limited
   - Clear notification when switching to demo endpoint permanently
   - No more repetitive "switching to demo" messages for every request

**Expected Result**: 
- ✅ First request tries API key, detects if exhausted
- ✅ Subsequent requests skip straight to demo endpoint if needed
- ✅ Faster processing with fewer error messages
- ✅ Clean logs focused on actual progress and results
- ✅ Automatic recovery if API key becomes available again

**File Modified**: `SolanaStaking.html` - Added smart API key exhaustion detection and cleaner logging

---

## Fix: Improved Fallback Logic for Network Errors

**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: When demo endpoint had network errors, the app wasn't falling back to the API key because it was marked as "exhausted" from rate limits.

**Problem**: 
- API key gets rate limited → marked as "exhausted"
- Demo endpoint has network issues → no fallback to API key
- Result: Many failed requests that could have succeeded with API key

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Smart Fallback Strategy**:
   - Still prefers demo endpoint when API key is rate limited
   - BUT always tries both endpoints when one fails with network errors
   - Uses circular logic to ensure both endpoints are attempted

2. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Rate limits only affect endpoint preference, not availability
   - Network errors trigger immediate fallback to other endpoint
   - Only fails when both endpoints have tried and failed

3. **Improved Messaging**:
   - Changed "API key exhausted" to "API key rate limited" (more accurate)
   - Clearer fallback messages showing which endpoint is being tried next

**Expected Behavior Now**:
- **API Key Rate Limited**: Prefers demo, but tries API key if demo fails
- **Demo Network Error**: Immediately tries API key as fallback
- **Best of Both**: Uses whichever endpoint is working at the moment

**File Modified**: `SolanaStaking.html` - Enhanced fallback logic to handle both rate limits and network errors

---

## Resilience: Added Retry Logic for Critical Initial Calls

**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: App was failing completely when initial `getStakeAccounts` or `getEpoch` calls hit network errors or rate limits, even though subsequent calls might work.

**Problem**: 
- Critical setup calls (`getStakeAccounts`, `getEpoch`) were single-attempt
- If these failed due to temporary network issues, entire process stopped
- No resilience for the most important initial data gathering

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Retry Logic for Critical Calls**:
   - `getStakeAccounts`: 3 attempts with 3-second delays
   - `getEpoch`: 3 attempts with 3-second delays
   - Clear progress messaging for each retry attempt

2. **Smart Failure Handling**:
   - Shows attempt number and error for each failure
   - Only fails completely after 3 attempts
   - Allows temporary network glitches to resolve themselves

3. **Better User Experience**:
   - Clear feedback about retry attempts in progress
   - Maintains existing fallback logic within each attempt
   - Reduces likelihood of complete failure due to temporary issues

**Expected Behavior**:
```
Fetching associated stake accounts...
⚠️ Attempt 1/3 failed: NetworkError
🔄 Retrying in 3 seconds...
⚠️ Attempt 2/3 failed: NetworkError  
🔄 Retrying in 3 seconds...
Found 1 stake account(s).
```

**Result**: Much higher success rate for completing the initial setup phase, allowing the app to proceed to the actual rewards processing.

**File Modified**: `SolanaStaking.html` - Added retry logic for critical initial RPC calls

---

## Emergency Fallback: Public RPC Endpoints for Critical Setup

**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: Both Alchemy API key and demo endpoints were failing simultaneously (rate limits + network errors), causing complete app failure during critical setup phase.

**Problem**: 
- API key completely exhausted with 429 rate limit errors
- Demo endpoint having network connectivity issues  
- No way to get basic setup data (`getStakeAccounts`, `getEpoch`) when both Alchemy endpoints fail
- App completely stops when it can't get past initial setup

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Emergency Fallback System**:
   - Added public RPC endpoints: Solana Official (`api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`) and PublicNode
   - Only used for critical setup calls when ALL Alchemy endpoints fail
   - Keeps Alchemy as primary for all rewards processing (better reliability for complex calls)

2. **Smart Fallback Logic**:
   - Primary: Try Alchemy endpoints first (API key + demo)
   - Emergency: If Alchemy completely fails, automatically try public endpoints
   - Clear logging shows when emergency fallbacks are being used

3. **Targeted Use**:
   - Emergency endpoints only used for `getStakeAccounts` and `getEpoch`
   - Rewards processing still uses Alchemy for better reliability
   - Minimizes load on public endpoints while ensuring app can start

**Expected Behavior**:
```
Using endpoint: Alchemy API Key...
❌ Failed: HTTP 429 (rate limited)
⚠️ Switching to Alchemy Demo endpoint...
❌ Failed: NetworkError
🚨 Trying emergency public endpoints...
🚨 Emergency fallback: Solana Official...
✅ Emergency connection successful: Solana Official
Found 1 stake account(s).
```

**Result**: App can now get past the initial setup phase even when both Alchemy endpoints are having issues, allowing it to proceed to rewards processing.

**File Modified**: `SolanaStaking.html` - Added emergency fallback system for critical setup calls

---

## Recent Epoch Data Availability Fix

**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: User reported epoch 805 consistently failing with "Block not available for slot" errors after 5+ retry attempts, even with different endpoints.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Epoch 805 was the current epoch when user ran the app
- Most recent epochs (current + previous 1-2) often don't have complete block data available yet in Solana RPC nodes
- RPC endpoints return -32004 "Block not available" errors for these recent epochs
- This is normal Solana behavior - block data becomes available with some delay

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Automatic Recent Epoch Exclusion**:
   - Now excludes the most recent 2 epochs from normal scanning ranges
   - Prevents wasted time trying to fetch unavailable data
   - Applied to all time range selections except manual epoch input

2. **Smart Skip Logic for Unavailable Blocks**:
   - If an epoch fails with "block unavailable" 3+ times, automatically mark it as "skipped"
   - Prevents infinite retry loops on legitimately unavailable data
   - These skipped epochs are excluded from future retry attempts

3. **Manual Epoch Warnings**:
   - When user manually specifies recent epochs, shows warning about potential unavailability
   - Still allows manual checking for users who want to try anyway

4. **Updated User Interface**:
   - UI tips now explain recent epoch exclusion
   - Better logging shows when epochs are excluded or skipped
   - Failed epoch counts exclude permanently skipped epochs

**Expected Behavior**:
```
Current epoch is 805. Fetching rewards...
Scanning epochs 793 to 803 (~2 months, excluding latest 2 epochs)...
✅ No more failed epoch 805 retries!
```

**Result**: 
- No more endless retries on unavailable recent epochs
- Faster processing by avoiding known problematic epochs
- User education about Solana's data availability timing
- Cleaner retry system that focuses on legitimately recoverable failures

**File Modified**: `SolanaStaking.html` - Added recent epoch exclusion and smart skip logic

---

## UI Improvement: Clear Database Now Resets Display

**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: User noted that clicking "Clear DB" cleared the database but left old rewards data displayed in the table, causing confusion.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced `clearDatabase()` function to also clear the UI display
- Now clears: rewards table, summary section, CSV content, and hides download button
- Provides immediate visual feedback that data has been cleared
- Eliminates confusion between database state and displayed data

**User Experience**: 
- ✅ Click "Clear DB" → Both database and display are cleared instantly
- ✅ Clean slate for fresh data collection
- ✅ No misleading old data shown after database clear

**File Modified**: `SolanaStaking.html` - Enhanced clear database function to reset UI display

---

## CSV Export: Updated to Koinly's Actual Required Format

**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: User reported that Koinly documentation was unclear and the CSV export wasn't using the correct headings for import.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated CSV export headers to match Koinly's actual requirements
- Changed from: `Koinly Date,Received Amount,Received Currency,Label,Description,TxHash`
- Changed to: `Koinly Date,Amount,Currency,Label,Description,TxHash`
- Kept comma-separated format (CSV) as required by Koinly
- Simplified column names to exactly match what Koinly expects

**Result**: 
- ✅ CSV exports now use Koinly's exact required format
- ✅ Should eliminate import issues caused by incorrect headers
- ✅ Proper comma-delimited CSV format for reliable imports

**File Modified**: `SolanaStaking.html` - Updated CSV export format for Koinly compatibility

---

## CSV & Epoch Count Fixes

**Date**: Current session  
**Issues**: 
1. CSV Description column had unnecessary quotes causing import issues
2. Time ranges were returning fewer epochs than expected due to recent epoch exclusion

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **CSV Description Field**: Removed quotes from description column
   - Changed from: `"Staking reward from account..."`
   - Changed to: `Staking reward from account...`
   - Cleaner CSV format without unnecessary quoting

2. **Epoch Count Correction**: Adjusted range calculations to account for excluding latest 2 epochs
   - "Last 10 epochs" now correctly returns 10 epochs (was returning 8)
   - "Last 30 epochs" now correctly returns 30 epochs (was returning 28)
   - All time ranges now deliver the expected number of epochs

**Technical Details**:
- Modified `minEpoch` calculation: `currentEpoch - selectedRange - 1` 
- This ensures we get the full requested range despite excluding the most recent 2 epochs
- CSV export now produces clean, unquoted description fields
- Math correction: For epoch 805, "Last 10" now scans 794-803 (10 epochs) excluding 804-805

**Result**: 
- ✅ CSV imports cleanly into Koinly without quote issues
- ✅ Time range selections return the exact number of epochs advertised
- ✅ Better user experience with predictable results

**File Modified**: `SolanaStaking.html` - Fixed CSV quoting and epoch count calculations

## Previous Entries

### Database System Implementation
User requested a database solution to handle intermittent RPC availability by storing successful results across multiple runs. Implemented comprehensive IndexedDB system with:
- **Two tables**: `rewards` (actual reward data) and `processedEpochs` (tracking processed epochs)
- **Incremental building**: Only processes epochs not already checked
- **Persistent storage**: Data survives browser restarts
- **Smart deduplication**: Combines new and saved rewards

### Rate Limiting Optimizations
Alchemy API was hitting rate limits (HTTP 429 errors). Applied optimizations:
- Increased delays between requests (500ms → 1000ms)
- Special handling for Alchemy rate limits (max 3 retries before switching to fallbacks)
- Initial 2-second delay at startup
- Longer waits when switching back to Alchemy (3 seconds)

### Full History Mode Implementation
User requested ability to fetch complete historical data with stop functionality:
- **Full History option**: Processes all epochs from current back to epoch 0
- **Stop button**: Orange button appears during processing, allows graceful stopping
- **Smart processing**: Only processes epochs not already in database
- **Progress tracking**: Shows processed count and estimated remaining for full history
- **Resume capability**: Can stop and resume later without losing progress

### Current Status
- Users can successfully collect staking reward transactions
- Database system working properly for incremental data building
- Application successfully finds stake accounts for user wallets
- API keys provide reliable access with rate limiting handled gracefully
- Data stored in browser's IndexedDB at location: Browser → Developer Tools → Application → Storage → IndexedDB → SolanaRewardsDB
