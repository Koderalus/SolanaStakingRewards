## Session Summary - Python & Solana Script Setup

**Date**: Current session
**Objective**: Help user install Python and get Solana transaction script running

### Events:

1. **Python Installation Check**
   - Discovered Python 3.12.7 was already installed
   - Verified `requests` library was available

2. **Script Debugging**
   - Original script used `ankr_getTransactionsByAddress` method
   - API returned "invalid argument 0: invalid params" error
   - Issue: Using Ankr's Advanced API method with incorrect parameters

3. **API Research**
   - Researched Ankr API documentation
   - Found that `ankr_getTransactionsByAddress` requires specific parameter format
   - Discovered API key didn't have Solana access permissions

4. **Solution Implementation**
   - Switched from Ankr's multichain endpoint to public Solana mainnet endpoint
   - Changed from `ankr_getTransactionsByAddress` to standard `getSignaturesForAddress` method
   - Updated parameter format to match Solana RPC specification

5. **Final Result**
   - ✅ Script successfully running
   - ✅ Fetching Solana transaction signatures
   - ✅ Displaying formatted transaction data including signatures, slots, timestamps, and confirmation status
   - ✅ Found 5 transactions for test address with detailed information

### Technical Details:
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`
- **Method**: `getSignaturesForAddress`
- **Language**: Python 3.12.7
- **Dependencies**: requests, json (built-in)

### Files Modified:
- `Sol.py` - Updated to use correct Solana RPC methods and endpoint

## Session Update - Solana Staking Rewards HTML App Fix

**Issue**: User reported 403 error when trying to use the Solana staking rewards web application

**Root Cause**: 
- Ankr RPC endpoint returning 403 Forbidden error
- Application trying to fetch ALL epochs from beginning of Solana (inefficient)
- No fallback RPC endpoints

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **RPC Endpoint Updates**:
   - Replaced single Ankr endpoint with multiple fallback endpoints
   - Added automatic failover between RPC providers
   - Primary: `api.mainnet-beta.solana.com` (official Solana)
   - Fallbacks: ProjectSerum, Ankr

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Limited epoch scanning to last ~2 years (730 epochs) instead of all history
   - Reduced batch sizes (50→25 epochs, 100→50 block times)
   - Added delays between requests to avoid rate limiting
   - Improved error handling with graceful degradation

3. **Reliability Improvements**:
   - Added retry logic with different RPC endpoints
   - Better error messages and status logging
   - Graceful handling of partial failures

**Expected Result**: Application should now work reliably for fetching Solana staking rewards and generating Koinly-compatible CSV files.

### Final Update - Rate Limiting & User Experience Improvements

**Issue**: Demo RPC endpoints were getting overwhelmed by parallel requests for historical data

**Additional Fixes**:
1. **Sequential Processing**: Changed from parallel batch processing to sequential epoch-by-epoch processing
2. **Respectful Rate Limiting**: Added 500ms delays between requests to avoid overwhelming free endpoints
3. **User Choice**: Added time range selector (2 months to 2 years) so users can choose speed vs completeness
4. **Better Progress Tracking**: Shows current progress (epoch X of Y) during processing
5. **Graceful Error Handling**: Skips failed epochs instead of stopping completely

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ Successfully connects via Alchemy demo endpoint
- ✅ Finds stake accounts correctly
- ✅ Processes rewards data sequentially with proper rate limiting
- ✅ Provides user control over time range vs speed tradeoff

### Files Modified:
- `SolanaStaking.html` - Complete overhaul of RPC handling, performance optimizations, and UX improvements 

## Latest Update: Smart Retry System for Missing Epochs

**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: User completed full history scan but was missing rewards for epochs 663 and 708. The application was marking failed epochs as "processed" and never retrying them.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Database Schema**: Added `errorType` and `retryCount` fields to track failure reasons and attempt counts
2. **Smart Retry Logic**: 
   - Distinguishes between different error types (rate_limit, network, block_unavailable, rpc_error)
   - Only marks epochs as truly "processed" when successful
   - Failed epochs remain eligible for retry based on error type and retry count
3. **Missing Epoch Detection**: New `findMissingEpochs()` function identifies gaps in data
4. **Retry Failed Button**: Yellow button appears when failed epochs exist, allows targeted retry
5. **Manual Epoch Check**: Purple "Check Specific" button reveals input field for checking specific epochs (e.g., "663, 708")
6. **Improved Status Display**: Shows successful vs failed epoch counts in database status

**Key Features**:
- Failed epochs with rate limits or network errors can be retried indefinitely
- RPC errors limited to 3 retries to avoid infinite loops
- Manual epoch input for targeted checking of specific missing epochs
- Smart processing that combines new epochs with retry candidates
- Better error categorization and logging

**Technical Changes**:
- Modified `markEpochAsProcessed()` to include error metadata
- Updated `getProcessedEpochs()` to filter by success status
- Added `getFailedEpochs()` and `findMissingEpochs()` functions
- Enhanced UI with retry and manual check buttons
- Improved error handling with specific error type detection

This ensures no epochs are permanently lost due to temporary RPC issues and provides tools for users to manually verify and retry specific epochs.

## Previous Entries

### Database System Implementation
User requested a database solution to handle intermittent RPC availability by storing successful results across multiple runs. Implemented comprehensive IndexedDB system with:
- **Two tables**: `rewards` (actual reward data) and `processedEpochs` (tracking processed epochs)
- **Incremental building**: Only processes epochs not already checked
- **Persistent storage**: Data survives browser restarts
- **Smart deduplication**: Combines new and saved rewards

### Rate Limiting Optimizations
Alchemy API was hitting rate limits (HTTP 429 errors). Applied optimizations:
- Increased delays between requests (500ms → 1000ms)
- Special handling for Alchemy rate limits (max 3 retries before switching to fallbacks)
- Initial 2-second delay at startup
- Longer waits when switching back to Alchemy (3 seconds)

### Full History Mode Implementation
User requested ability to fetch complete historical data with stop functionality:
- **Full History option**: Processes all epochs from current back to epoch 0
- **Stop button**: Orange button appears during processing, allows graceful stopping
- **Smart processing**: Only processes epochs not already in database
- **Progress tracking**: Shows processed count and estimated remaining for full history
- **Resume capability**: Can stop and resume later without losing progress

### Current Status
- User successfully collected 167 staking reward transactions
- Database system working properly with 31 epochs processed
- Application successfully finds stake account `DkgzPrqMvx8s1zMx9G3iLkTK6VrHjy9cTvD3jnJ4WPSS`
- Alchemy API key providing reliable access with occasional rate limiting handled gracefully
- Data stored in browser's IndexedDB at location: Browser → Developer Tools → Application → Storage → IndexedDB → SolanaRewardsDB
