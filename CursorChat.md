## Session Summary - Python & Solana Script Setup

**Date**: Current session
**Objective**: Help user install Python and get Solana transaction script running

### Events:

1. **Python Installation Check**
   - Discovered Python 3.12.7 was already installed
   - Verified `requests` library was available

2. **Script Debugging**
   - Original script used `ankr_getTransactionsByAddress` method
   - API returned "invalid argument 0: invalid params" error
   - Issue: Using Ankr's Advanced API method with incorrect parameters

3. **API Research**
   - Researched Ankr API documentation
   - Found that `ankr_getTransactionsByAddress` requires specific parameter format
   - Discovered API key didn't have Solana access permissions

4. **Solution Implementation**
   - Switched from Ankr's multichain endpoint to public Solana mainnet endpoint
   - Changed from `ankr_getTransactionsByAddress` to standard `getSignaturesForAddress` method
   - Updated parameter format to match Solana RPC specification

5. **Final Result**
   - âœ… Script successfully running
   - âœ… Fetching Solana transaction signatures
   - âœ… Displaying formatted transaction data including signatures, slots, timestamps, and confirmation status
   - âœ… Found 5 transactions for test address with detailed information

### Technical Details:
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`
- **Method**: `getSignaturesForAddress`
- **Language**: Python 3.12.7
- **Dependencies**: requests, json (built-in)

### Files Modified:
- `Sol.py` - Updated to use correct Solana RPC methods and endpoint

## Session Update - Solana Staking Rewards HTML App Fix

**Issue**: User reported 403 error when trying to use the Solana staking rewards web application

**Root Cause**: 
- Ankr RPC endpoint returning 403 Forbidden error
- Application trying to fetch ALL epochs from beginning of Solana (inefficient)
- No fallback RPC endpoints

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **RPC Endpoint Updates**:
   - Replaced single Ankr endpoint with multiple fallback endpoints
   - Added automatic failover between RPC providers
   - Primary: `api.mainnet-beta.solana.com` (official Solana)
   - Fallbacks: ProjectSerum, Ankr

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Limited epoch scanning to last ~2 years (730 epochs) instead of all history
   - Reduced batch sizes (50â†’25 epochs, 100â†’50 block times)
   - Added delays between requests to avoid rate limiting
   - Improved error handling with graceful degradation

3. **Reliability Improvements**:
   - Added retry logic with different RPC endpoints
   - Better error messages and status logging
   - Graceful handling of partial failures

**Expected Result**: Application should now work reliably for fetching Solana staking rewards and generating Koinly-compatible CSV files.

### Final Update - Rate Limiting & User Experience Improvements

**Issue**: Demo RPC endpoints were getting overwhelmed by parallel requests for historical data

**Additional Fixes**:
1. **Sequential Processing**: Changed from parallel batch processing to sequential epoch-by-epoch processing
2. **Respectful Rate Limiting**: Added 500ms delays between requests to avoid overwhelming free endpoints
3. **User Choice**: Added time range selector (2 months to 2 years) so users can choose speed vs completeness
4. **Better Progress Tracking**: Shows current progress (epoch X of Y) during processing
5. **Graceful Error Handling**: Skips failed epochs instead of stopping completely

**Current Status**: 
- âœ… Successfully connects via Alchemy demo endpoint
- âœ… Finds stake accounts correctly
- âœ… Processes rewards data sequentially with proper rate limiting
- âœ… Provides user control over time range vs speed tradeoff

### Files Modified:
- `SolanaStaking.html` - Complete overhaul of RPC handling, performance optimizations, and UX improvements 

## Latest Update: Public Sharing Preparation

**Date**: Current session  
**Action**: Made the application suitable for public sharing by removing hardcoded personal data and adding configurable API keys.

**Changes Made**:
1. **Added API Key Input Field**: Users can now enter their own Alchemy API key for better reliability
2. **Local Configuration Storage**: API keys and wallet addresses are saved in localStorage and auto-populated
3. **Removed Hardcoded Keys**: Eliminated personal API keys and wallet addresses from the code
4. **Created .gitignore**: Added gitignore file to exclude personal configuration files
5. **Dynamic RPC URLs**: RPC endpoints are now built dynamically based on provided API keys
6. **Cleaned Documentation**: Removed personal references from documentation files

**Files Added**:
- `config.json` - Template for personal configuration (gitignored)
- `.gitignore` - Excludes personal data from repository

**Privacy & Security**:
- âœ… No personal API keys or wallet addresses in repository
- âœ… Configuration stored locally in browser (not in files)
- âœ… API key input uses password field type
- âœ… Safe for public GitHub sharing

## Final Security Update: Proper External Config Loading

**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: The previous approach had hardcoded personal values as "defaults" which could be used by others accessing the HTML file.

**Security Fix**:
1. **Removed Hardcoded Values**: No personal data embedded in HTML code anymore
2. **External Config Loading**: App loads from `config.json` file (if it exists locally)
3. **Graceful Fallback**: If no config.json exists, starts with empty fields
4. **Config Download**: Users can download their own config.json file for future use

**How It Works Now**:
- **For You**: Place config.json in same directory as HTML â†’ Auto-loads your settings
- **For Others**: No config.json â†’ Starts with empty fields, they enter their own data
- **Config Saving**: "ðŸ’¾ Save Config" button downloads config.json with user's settings

**Final Security State**:
- âœ… Zero personal data in HTML file
- âœ… Zero risk of others using your API keys
- âœ… Completely safe for public sharing
- âœ… Convenient auto-loading for personal use

## Previous Update: Project Cleanup - Removed Unused Python Script

**Date**: Previous session  
**Action**: Removed `Sol.py` as it was not needed for the HTML staking rewards application.

**Analysis**:
- `Sol.py` was a simple Python script for fetching transaction signatures using `getSignaturesForAddress`
- `SolanaStaking.html` is a complete web application with its own JavaScript-based RPC client
- No dependencies between the two files - HTML app is fully self-contained
- Different purposes: Sol.py was for basic transaction testing, HTML is for staking rewards

**Current Project State**:
- âœ… SolanaStaking.html - Complete staking rewards web application (standalone)
- âœ… No Python dependencies required
- âœ… All functionality contained within the HTML file
- âœ… Python virtual environment (.venv) removed - no longer needed

## Previous Update: Smart Retry System for Missing Epochs

**Date**: Previous session  
**Issue**: User completed full history scan but was missing rewards for epochs 663 and 708. The application was marking failed epochs as "processed" and never retrying them.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Database Schema**: Added `errorType` and `retryCount` fields to track failure reasons and attempt counts
2. **Smart Retry Logic**: 
   - Distinguishes between different error types (rate_limit, network, block_unavailable, rpc_error)
   - Only marks epochs as truly "processed" when successful
   - Failed epochs remain eligible for retry based on error type and retry count
3. **Missing Epoch Detection**: New `findMissingEpochs()` function identifies gaps in data
4. **Retry Failed Button**: Yellow button appears when failed epochs exist, allows targeted retry
5. **Manual Epoch Check**: Purple "Check Specific" button reveals input field for checking specific epochs (e.g., "663, 708")
6. **Improved Status Display**: Shows successful vs failed epoch counts in database status

**Key Features**:
- Failed epochs with rate limits or network errors can be retried indefinitely
- RPC errors limited to 3 retries to avoid infinite loops
- Manual epoch input for targeted checking of specific missing epochs
- Smart processing that combines new epochs with retry candidates
- Better error categorization and logging

**Technical Changes**:
- Modified `markEpochAsProcessed()` to include error metadata
- Updated `getProcessedEpochs()` to filter by success status
- Added `getFailedEpochs()` and `findMissingEpochs()` functions
- Enhanced UI with retry and manual check buttons
- Improved error handling with specific error type detection

This ensures no epochs are permanently lost due to temporary RPC issues and provides tools for users to manually verify and retry specific epochs.

## Previous Entries

### Database System Implementation
User requested a database solution to handle intermittent RPC availability by storing successful results across multiple runs. Implemented comprehensive IndexedDB system with:
- **Two tables**: `rewards` (actual reward data) and `processedEpochs` (tracking processed epochs)
- **Incremental building**: Only processes epochs not already checked
- **Persistent storage**: Data survives browser restarts
- **Smart deduplication**: Combines new and saved rewards

### Rate Limiting Optimizations
Alchemy API was hitting rate limits (HTTP 429 errors). Applied optimizations:
- Increased delays between requests (500ms â†’ 1000ms)
- Special handling for Alchemy rate limits (max 3 retries before switching to fallbacks)
- Initial 2-second delay at startup
- Longer waits when switching back to Alchemy (3 seconds)

### Full History Mode Implementation
User requested ability to fetch complete historical data with stop functionality:
- **Full History option**: Processes all epochs from current back to epoch 0
- **Stop button**: Orange button appears during processing, allows graceful stopping
- **Smart processing**: Only processes epochs not already in database
- **Progress tracking**: Shows processed count and estimated remaining for full history
- **Resume capability**: Can stop and resume later without losing progress

### Current Status
- Users can successfully collect staking reward transactions
- Database system working properly for incremental data building
- Application successfully finds stake accounts for user wallets
- API keys provide reliable access with rate limiting handled gracefully
- Data stored in browser's IndexedDB at location: Browser â†’ Developer Tools â†’ Application â†’ Storage â†’ IndexedDB â†’ SolanaRewardsDB
